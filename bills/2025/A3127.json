 "Title":"Relates to workers' access to treatment",
 "Summary":"Allows for treatment costing less than $1,500 to be done without prior approval, and more clearly defines the list of \"pre-authorized procedures\" as a floor on treatment as opposed to its current status as a ceiling; allows non-network providers of testing to be compensated at the provider network rate negotiated by the carrier.",

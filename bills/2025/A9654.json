 "Title":"Enacts the New York Artificial Intelligence Civil Rights Act",
 "Summary":"Enacts the New York Artificial Intelligence Civil Rights Act establishing protections for individual rights with respect to computational algorithms; establishes protections against the use of algorithms involved in consequential decisions, such as those that impact people's rights, civil liberties, and livelihoods, including employment, banking, health care, the criminal justice system, public accommodations, and government services; prohibits developers and deployers from offering, licensing, or using covered algorithms that discriminate based on protected characteristics or that cause a disparate impact; requires developers and deployers of covered algorithms to complete independently audited pre-deployment evaluations and post-deployment impact assessments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate any potential biased use or discriminatory outcomes; requires developers and deployers to mitigate any harms identified by the pre-deployment evaluations and impact assessments and ensure that any covered algorithm performs reasonably well and is consistent with its publicly-advertised purpose; increases transparency around the use of covered algorithms in consequential decisions, including providing individuals a right to appeal an algorithmic decision to a human decision-maker; provides remedies for violations.",

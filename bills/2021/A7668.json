 "Title":"Relates to false claims about recyclability and plastic container labelling",
 "Summary":"Provides that it is deceptive to misrepresent that a product or package is recyclable unless it can be collected, separated or otherwise recovered from the waste stream through an established recycling program for reuse or use in manufacturing or assembling another item; requires the department of environmental conservation to develop regulations on types and forms of plastic products and packaging for which a claim of recyclability may be made; requires all rigid plastic containers sold in this state be labeled with a code that indicates the resin used to produce such container; makes related provisions.",
